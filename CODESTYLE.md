## Using marks

For clean struct code good is using marks. 

```swift
class Example {

    // MARK: - Init
    
    init() {}
}
```

Here you find all which using in project.

- // MARK: - Init
- // MARK: - Lifecycle
- // MARK: - Layout
- // MARK: - Helpers

If you can't find valid, add new to codestyle agreements please. Other can be use if class is large and need struct it even without adding to codestyle agreements.
